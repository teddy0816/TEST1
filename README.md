# Program README

## 1. Code Overview
The code is written in C++. It can be compiled in any C++ IDE.

## 2. Input Data
The input data for this program is provided in a text file named `input.txt`.  
The first line of `input.txt` contains a single integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines:
- The first line indicates the length of the array.
- The second line contains the array itself.

## 3. Output Data
The program generates two output files: `output.txt` and `timingdata.txt`.  
- **`output.txt`** displays the sorted arrays. Each array is printed three times, showing the results of Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, respectively.
- **`timingdata.txt`** provides timing information for each test case, including the array length and the runtime of each sorting algorithm. The time is recorded in seconds.

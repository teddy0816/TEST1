# Program README

## 1. Code Overview
The code is written in C++. It can be compiled in any C++ IDE.

## 2. Input Data
- The input files include:
  - `input.txt`: Contains a list of numbers to be inserted into the BST and Hash Table.
  - `op.txt`: Contains commands (either "Search" or "Delete") followed by a number. These commands are alternately processed by both the BST and the Hash Table.

## 3. Output Data
- The output files generated are:
  - `output_bst.txt`: Contains the traversal results (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder) and the results of "Search" and "Delete" commands for the BST.
  - `output_hash.txt`: Contains the results of "Search" and "Delete" commands for the Hash Table.
  - `performance_summary.txt`: Contains the time taken for insertion and search operations in both the BST and the Hash Table.

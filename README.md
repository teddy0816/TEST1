1. My code was wroten in C++\
Complile in any IDE.

2. Input data of this program is a text file named "input.txt"\
The first line of "input.txt" is a single integer meaning number of test cases. And following n lines are testcases, each of them is two integer to multiply.
3. Output data of this program are two text file named "output.txt" and "timingdata.txt"\
"output.txt" shows product of multiplication. Each number has printed twice show the product of "Basic" and "Karatsuba" multiplication.\
"timingdata" shows timingdata of each cases. Unit of them is seconds and you can see digits, runtime of Basic multiplication, Karatsuba multiplication for each case.

# Program README

## 1. Code Overview
The code is written in C++. It can be compiled in any C++ IDE.  
The code solves MCMF problem.

## 2. Input Data
The input file `input.txt` should be formatted as follows:

- The first line contains two integers: the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
- The following `m` lines each contain three integers: the starting node of an edge, the ending node of an edge(between 1 and n), the weight of the edge.(between 100)
- The last line contains also contains two integers: `Source` and `Sink`.

## 3. Output Data

### `output.txt`

This file contains the results of the computations:
  - Maximum flow value.
  - Minimum cut value.
  - Edges included in the minimum cut.

### `timingdata.txt`

This file compares the execution times.
